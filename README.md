# 🛡️ Fintech Fraud Detection & Risk Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed 50,000+ financial transactions to identify fraudulent patterns and quantify business risk. This project focuses on deep-dive data exploration to detect anomalies and segment users based on their risk profiles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Processing:** SQL (Views, Complex Joins)
- **Analytics Tool:** Power BI
- **Core Methodology:** Trend Analysis & Risk Profiling

## 🔍 Fraud Pattern Identification (The Core Logic)
- **High-Risk Segment Analysis:** Segmented customers into Low, Medium, and High-risk categories based on verification status and transaction history.
- **Geographic Hotspots:** Identified specific regions/states with disproportionately high fraud rates to suggest localized security tightening.
- **Transaction Velocity Analysis:** Identified accounts showing suspicious high-frequency transactions within short timeframes (e.g., <1 hour).
- **Impossible Travel Logic:** Flagged accounts with login/transaction attempts from different geographic locations in an impossibly short time.

## 🚀 Business Impact & Insights
- **Fraud Exposure Calculation:** Tracked the total monetary value at risk vs. total revenue to provide a "Risk Heatmap" for management.
- **Merchant Performance:** Evaluated merchants with the highest chargeback rates to optimize partner onboarding.
- **User Trust Optimization:** Analyzed the impact of fraud on legitimate users to ensure security measures don't hinder "Good Transactions."
- **Trend Forecasting:** Identified peak fraud periods (e.g., holidays/festivals) to help the team prepare for high-risk seasons.
